            <h3>jvascript programming language</h2>
    
            <h3>JavaScript is the world's most popular programming language.JavaScript is the programming language of the Web.JavaScript is easy to learn.In 1995, JavaScript was created by a developer named Brendan Eich. First, it was called Mocha that later was renamed to LiveScript and then Javascript. 
             Javascript is a high-level scripting and interpreted programming language. Now, there are three important phrases to understand here. High level, Scripting, and Interpreted.

             High-Level Language : - High-Level Language is a language which humans can understand and write easily. For example, English can be read by us easily. And JavaScript code also can be read by us humans easily.
             Scripting Language:- Scripting language is a language which converts our human-readable code into machine code. Machine code, as you may know, exists as 1s and 0s  and we will call it a low level language also.
             Interpreted Programming Language :-  An Interpreter read over the JavaScript code, one line at a time, and runs it. Javascript is run by Interpreter. Some other languages, like Java, for instance, are run by something called a Compiler. A compiler does not run the code line by line. Instead, it reads the entire code and then runs it.</h3>
